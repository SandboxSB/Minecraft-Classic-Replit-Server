# Authentication services configuration
#   There is no reason to modify these configuration settings, unless the server has been configured
#    to send heartbeats to multiple authentication services (e.g. both ClassiCube.net and BetaCraft.pl)
#   DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING

#URL = string
#   URL of the authentication service the following settings apply to
#   (this must be the same as one of the heartbeat URLs specified in server.properties)
#name-suffix = string
#   Characters that are appended to usernames of players that login through the authentication service
#   (used to prevent username collisions between authentication services that would otherwise occur)
#skin-prefix = string
#   Characters that are prefixed to skin name of players that login through the authentication service
#   (used to ensure players from other authentication services see the correct skin)
